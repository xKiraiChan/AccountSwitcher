# AccountSwitcher
Account switcher for VRChat

# Usage

First, create a file `UserData/kAccounts.txt`

The format for this file is `User:Pass\n`

Example:

```
Example1:Password1
Example2:Password2
Example3:Password3
```

Once you have your accounts added, hold TAB while in game for the UI.

# Todo: 

- [ ] Auto TOS accept
- [ ] Optimisations when clicking elements

- Note: it may be more efficient to find an ingame method to call rather than using the UI, however, this may break between updates without proper XRef scanning and I have been using OB2 recently so this is the approach I thought of first.
